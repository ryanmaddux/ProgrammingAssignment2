Here are some things to note that may help you use this function

First, load the the functions into R.

To do this, change the directory to wherever you saved this function

setwd("Insert_Your_Directory_Here")

Next, source the functions

source("cachematrix.R")

Now, define a matrix.  For example:

f <- matrix(2:5, 2, 2)

Next, create the "special" object that stores info about the vector and store it.  For example:

fortheguild <- makeCacheMatrix(f)

Next, run the cacheSolve function on the list we just created

cacheSolve(fortheguild)

You should get a reasonable output.  For example:

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3  2.5
[2,]    2 -1.5

Now, run it again:

cacheSolve(fortheguild)

getting cached data
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3  2.5
[2,]    2 -1.5

Shazam!
